# Transformer-based Image Captioning Using Vision Transformer

## Introduction
This document provides detailed documentation of the preprocessing and fine-tuning steps for a Vision Transformer (ViT) as an encoder and GPT-2 as a decoder in an image captioning model implemented in Google Colab. The code prepares image and caption data for training the model and performs fine-tuning to generate descriptive captions for input images.

## Dependencies and Libraries
The pre-processing and training code relies on several key libraries and functionalities:

- `transformers`: Provides access to pre-trained models (`ViTImageProcessor` and `AutoTokenizer`) and tokenization functionalities.
- `torch`: Enables tensor operations and data manipulation.
- `torchvision`: Facilitates image transformations.
- `pandas`: Used for reading data from CSV files containing image filenames and captions.
- `Pillow` (PIL Fork): Used for image loading and manipulation.
- `tqdm`: Optional library for monitoring data processing progress.
- `multiprocessing`: Optional library for parallel processing to expedite data loading.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Optional library for data visualization (not directly used in pre-processing).

## Pre-Processing
The pre-processing phase involves several key functionalities:

### Special Token Handling
A custom function is defined within the `AutoTokenizer` class to ensure captions are appropriately wrapped with special tokens (e.g., BOS - Beginning of Sentence, EOS - End of Sentence) before feeding them to the model.

### Loading Pre-trained Models
- `ViTImageProcessor`: Utilized to process images for the ViT encoder, resizing, normalizing, and extracting features to make them compatible with the ViT model.
- `AutoTokenizer`: Used to tokenize captions for the GPT-2 decoder, converting textual captions into numerical token sequences.

### Image Pre-processing
Image pre-processing involves normalization of pixel values and applying a sequence of transformations (e.g., resizing) using `transforms.Compose`.

## Fine-tuning the Model
The model fine-tuning phase encompasses the following steps:

### Code Breakdown

#### Loading the Pre-trained Model
The pre-trained `VisionEncoderDecoderModel` is retrieved and moved to the GPU for accelerated training.

#### Configuration Adjustments
Specific attributes within the model's configuration (`model.config`) are adjusted, such as setting vocabulary size, maximum caption length, and beam search parameters.

#### Training Arguments
Training arguments are defined using `Seq2SeqTrainingArguments`, specifying parameters for training, evaluation, and model checkpointing.
#### Model Training
The model is trained and evaluated using the `Seq2SeqTrainer` with specified training and validation datasets.
